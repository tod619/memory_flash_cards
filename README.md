# memory_flash_cards

## Description

Question and answer memory flash cards that are created by the user. The question is displayed on one side of the card and the answer on the other. When the user clicks on the flip button the cards flip over and the answer is displayed and the question is hidden. The user can create a card by clicking on the add card button. The user is then presented with a form where they must enter a question and an answer. The card is stored in local storage and displayed back to the user on the screen. The user can create as many cards as they wish. The cards persist when the user closes the browser because they are stored in local storage. When the user clicks on the clear cards button all cards are removed from local storage.
